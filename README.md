# iTrust
iTrust is a medical record system from open source. We implemented further developments on its functionalities, and built and deployed a tomcat server with Maven and bash script.

1. Implemented a front-end website with jQuery and jsp
2. Supported new patient pre-registration, pre-registration patient activation, message displaying filter, automatic reminders of appointment, and filtered transaction logs
3. Added unit tests with JUnit and Mockito framework, and selenium tests to reach at least 85% statement coverage for each non-GUI class
